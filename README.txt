Hello,
my name is Przemyslaw Grabowski and this is my first project on AVR microcontroller.

As it's name may suggest it is a simple calculator, which receives some numbers and makes proper calculations. 

For this project I am using Atmega8A, 16-key keyboard, 4x seven-segment display and few LEDs with resitors.

The aim is to make a simple tool...
